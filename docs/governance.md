# Governance Model and DAO Structure

## Introduction

The governance model of the **stable-pi-core** project is designed to ensure decentralized decision-making and community involvement. This document outlines the structure of the Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) and the governance processes.

## DAO Structure

### 1. Governance Token

- **Token Name**: Pi Governance Token (PGT)
- **Purpose**: Holders of PGT have voting rights on proposals and changes to the protocol.

### 2. Governance Body

- **Members**: Composed of PGT holders who participate in governance.
- **Voting Power**: Each PGT token represents one vote.

## Governance Processes

### 1. Proposal Submission

- Any member can submit a proposal for changes or improvements to the protocol.
- Proposals must include a clear description, rationale, and potential impact.

### 2. Voting Process

- Proposals are open for voting for a specified period (e.g., 7 days).
- Members can vote "Yes," "No," or abstain from voting.
- A proposal is considered approved if it receives a majority of "Yes" votes.

### 3. Implementation

- Approved proposals are implemented by the core development team.
- Updates are communicated to the community through official channels.

## Conclusion

The governance model of **stable-pi-core** empowers the community to participate actively in the decision-making process, ensuring that the project evolves in a way that reflects the interests of its stakeholders.
